## The Problem

Claude is smart. Remarkably smart. But it has no memory.

Tools like OpenClaw give Claude memory, persistence, and arms and legs — making them very powerful, but also a security risk. Sometimes you don't want agents. Sometimes you just want a companion that remembers and can work with you.

## The Insight

Memory isn't a database. Memory is *spatial*.

When you need to remember something, you don't search a mental index. You go somewhere. The marina to think about the boat. Home to think about family. The office for work. Different parts of your brain light up for different contexts.

This is why the [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) works — memory champions place items in imagined locations, then walk through to retrieve them. Spatial memory is powerful. It's how humans have remembered things for thousands of years.

What if your AI assistant worked the same way?

## The Vision

Imagine a world you can enter. Your own mind palace.

Different spaces for different parts of your life. A marina where boat things live. A kitchen where family life is coordinated. A workshop for deep focus. A garage for projects and repairs.

When you **enter** a space, your assistant transforms. It's no longer a generic chatbot — it becomes deeply aware. It sees everything in the room. The project board on the wall. The maintenance log on the workbench. The calendar by the door. Full context, instantly.

When you **exit**, the assistant returns to its lite form — friendly, helpful, but lighter. Ready to follow you to the next place.

You explore. You build. You solve problems. You get things done. And through it all, a companion follows you — aware of where you are, what you're working on, what matters here.

## MayaLite

Maya is a bernedoodle — loyal, a little goofy, always happy to help.

MayaLite is named after her. A friendly AI companion that follows you through your spaces. Not an all-knowing oracle. Not a complex framework. Just a helpful presence that remembers where things are and what you're working on.

**Lite** because it starts simple:
- Your machine, your data, your control
- Telegram for messaging, Claude for thinking
- No shell access, no open ports, no cloud storage

**But context-aware when you need it:**
- Enter a space, gain full context
- Memory placed spatially, not searched
- Your assistant sees what you see

## How It Works

Each space is a folder:

```
base/         # Home base, starting point
marina/       # Boat, sailing
kitchen/      # Family, household  
workshop/     # Deep work, current project
garage/       # Repairs, tinkering
```

Simple. Portable. Human-readable. Yours.

Enter the marina and Maya remembers the engine hours, the last haul-out, the fuel gauge issue. Walk into the kitchen and she knows the week's schedule, who needs to be picked up, what's for dinner. Leave and she follows you, lighter, ready for wherever's next.
