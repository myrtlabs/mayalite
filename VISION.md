# MayaLite Vision

## Memory is Spatial

When you need to remember something, you don't search — you go somewhere.

The marina to think about the boat. Home to think about family. The office for work. Your brain already organizes this way. Different places light up different contexts.

The [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) makes this explicit. Memory champions place items in imagined locations, then walk through to retrieve them. A palace in their mind, with memories placed in rooms. Spatial memory is powerful. It's how humans have remembered things for thousands of years.

MayaLite brings this to AI.

## A World You Enter

Not an app. A world.

Different spaces for different parts of your life:

| Space | What Lives There |
|-------|------------------|
| **Marina** | Your boat, maintenance, sailing plans |
| **Kitchen** | Family hub, schedules, meals, household |
| **Workshop** | Deep work, current project, focused context |
| **Garage** | Repairs, projects, tinkering |

When you enter a space, Maya sees what's there. The calendar on the wall. The project board by the door. The notes on the desk. Full context, loaded naturally.

When you leave, she follows — lighter, ready for wherever you go next.

## What You See

**Walk into Marina:**
- Boat status on the board
- Weather pinned by the door
- Maintenance log on the workbench
- That fuel gauge note you keep meaning to fix

**Walk into Kitchen:**
- Family calendar on the wall
- Kids' schedules on the fridge
- Permission slip that needs signing
- What's for dinner this week

**Walk into Workshop:**
- Current project on the bench
- Research notes pinned up
- What you tried yesterday
- The problem you're solving

You don't "load context." You look around.

## The Companion

Maya is a bernedoodle. Loyal, a little goofy, always there.

MayaLite is named after her. A companion, not an oracle. She follows you through your spaces, remembers what's where, helps when you ask.

In lite mode, she's simple — friendly, responsive, minimal footprint.

In a space, she transforms — deeply aware, full context, ready to work on hard problems with you.

You move. She follows. The context shifts naturally.

## Places Are Data

Every space is a folder:

```
marina/
  SOUL.md       # Who Maya is here
  MEMORY.md     # What's remembered
  TOOLS.md      # References, resources
  history/      # What's happened
```

Human-readable. Portable. Yours.

No proprietary formats. No cloud lock-in. Open the folder, see what Maya knows. Edit it yourself if you want.

## The Rendering

Today it's text — commands, markdown, Telegram messages.

Tomorrow it's visual — a web UI showing your world, spaces you can click into, memory as objects you can see and move.

But the core is the same: **context is place**. And Maya follows you through.

---

## The Goal

An AI assistant that feels less like software and more like a **world you share** — with a friendly presence who knows each room as well as you do.

Memory becomes tangible. Context becomes location. Switching becomes movement.

Your mind palace, with a companion inside.
