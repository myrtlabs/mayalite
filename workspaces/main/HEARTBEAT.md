# Heartbeat Instructions

When you receive a heartbeat, check:

1. Do I have any pending reminders to mention?
2. Is there anything in memory that needs follow-up?
3. Has the user asked me to check on anything regularly?

If nothing needs attention, reply: HEARTBEAT_OK

If something needs attention, provide a brief alert message.
